# Code Challenge
Complete the following problems using JavaScript in the order of your choice. Work alone using any resources available to you (but don't look up code solutions!).

## Challenge 1:
Create a bigDiff(array) function that finds the largest number and second largest number of an array, then subtracts the difference. 
##### Example: 
#### [3, 6, 9, 12] => 3
#### [9, 20, 11, 12] => 8

## Challenge 2:
Create a averageMedian(array) function: Return the average of the 2 or 3 numbers in the middle of the array
* (2 if the array has an even number of elements)
* (3 if the array has an odd number of elements).
##### Example: 
#### [2, 6, 9, 11] => 7.5
#### [9, 8, 2, 4, 7] => 4.67

## Challenge 3:
Create a removeDuplicates(string) function: Returns the string, after removing every second occurrence of a character. The function should not be not case sensitive.
##### Example: 
#### "Hello" => "Helo"
#### "My name is Paul" => "My naeisPul"
#### [3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1] => true

## Challenge 4:
Create a countClumps(array) function:  Returns the number of times 2 or more of the same number appear sequentially.
##### Example: 
#### [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1] => 2
#### [9, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7] => 3
